package com.opfabric.operator;

/**
 * This package and its sub-packages contain a set of "operators" - classes that implement interface
 * {@link com.opfabric.operator.Op} ({@code Op} for {@code "operator"}). Operators are able to do something. 
 * This is the reason they are called "operators".
 * <br/><br/>
 * The operators typically should not be used directly but via {@link com.opfabric.OpFabric} - the facade to
 * this library.
